# Option-pricing-project

Option pricing have been a topic of interest for many years in the financial industry. There are
several option pricing methods, including Binomial trees and Monte-Carlo simulations. The first
one has been introduced in 1979 by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein while the second one was applied
first in 1977 by Phelim Boyle.
In this project, we have implemented both option pricing methods. The simulation allows
users to calculate the price of an option knowing the current price of the underlying asset, the
strike price and the time to maturity. The simulation was implemented using computer science
principles and algorithms, including data structures and mathematical models.
